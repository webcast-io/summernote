This is a fork of the [Summernote](https://github.com/HackerWins/summernote) Bootstrap WYSIWYG editor.

The only change is that any HTML which contains class names beginning with `icon-` have been removed. The reason for this is due to clashes in icon fonts between the Font Awesome library that Summernote uses and Bootstrap.
